## Regex Engine

This project was abandoned in mid-effort and is unfinished.

### Next steps:

 1. Take the working [Glob expansion program](https://github.com/brannerchinese/algorithm_play/tree/master/python_substrings_glob) and add a lexer so that character sets can be handled.
 1. Change from Glob expansion to Regex proper.
 1. Add disjunction.
 1. Add browser-based visualization.
